Headcased has been created to help further hairdressers' education. You can save videos to your account to watch at your
leisure and to learn from.

Things I want to change:

* Styling to make all the links line up correctly

* Add JQuery event listeners and have the site send emails (forgot password, sign up to newsletter etc.)

Check it out in Heroku: https://headcased.herokuapp.com

Take a look around and let me know what you think!
